          PM Compass is a short, 12‑scenario survey that helps you see which of six
          product management orientations you lean toward in practice:
          <strong>Advocate</strong>, <strong>Innovator</strong>, <strong>Technologist</strong>,
          <strong>Architect</strong>, <strong>Strategist</strong>, and <strong>Operator</strong>.
          It’s inspired by the framing in
          <a href="https://sociotechnical.org/archive/six-flavors-of-product-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Flavors of Product Management</a>
          on Sociotechnical.

          For each A/B prompt, choose where you land on a 5‑point scale from
          <em>Definitely (left)</em> to <em>Definitely (right)</em>. You can go back
          and forth; your picks are preserved, and changing an answer updates your score.
          At the end, you’ll see a breakdown by orientation and a point plotted inside
          a colorful User–Tech–Business triangle.
